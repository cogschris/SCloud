# SCloud
We decided to create a folder for every UI page in the SCloud application. For example, the ArtistSearchPage folder contains all the bootstrap CSS files and HTML files, since we'll be altering individual Bootstrap CSS files for each page.

So make sure you add all your HTML, CSS, and any other corresponding files to a folder corresponding to a specific page.
